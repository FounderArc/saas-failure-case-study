# 🚀 SaaS Failure Case Study

A transparent breakdown of why my SaaS startup failed after 2 month of building — and the lessons every founder should learn before starting.

Instead of hiding the failure, I decided to document everything publicly so other builders can avoid the same mistakes.

## 📖 About This Project

This repository contains a complete postmortem of my SaaS journey.

I spent 2 month designing, building, and launching a product that ultimately failed to generate revenue or traction.

Through this experience, I discovered critical mistakes in:
- Idea validation
- Product-market fit
- Marketing strategy
- Execution
- Customer acquisition

This case study explains exactly what went wrong and what I would do differently today.

## 💡 Why I'm Sharing This

Most people share only success stories.

I believe failures teach more.

If this saves even one founder months or years of wasted effort, it’s worth sharing.
